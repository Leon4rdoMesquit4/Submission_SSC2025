# 🚀 Swift Student Challenge 2025 - Submission

Welcome to my submission for the **Swift Student Challenge 2025**! This project is an interactive Swift Playground that showcases creativity, technical skills, and innovative use of Swift and SwiftUI.

## 📱 Project Overview

**折り紙: A Tale of Folding Paper** The experience begins with a brief history of origami, allowing users to fold a traditional tsuru (crane). Then, it transitions to real-world applications, demonstrating how origami principles are used in medicine and space exploration.

Users engage with two interactive challenges:
🚀 **Space Engineering** – Unfold the James Webb Space Telescope’s sunshield, just as NASA did in space.
🏥 **Medical Innovation** – Expand an origami-inspired stent to restore blood flow in a blocked artery.

Through simple gestures like dragging and swiping, users experience firsthand how origami-inspired designs solve complex problems.

## 💻 Technologies Used

- **Swift 6.0:** The foundation of the entire project.
- **SwiftUI:** For building modern and responsive user interfaces.
- **AVFoundation:** To add audio effects.
